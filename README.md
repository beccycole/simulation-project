# Simulation Project

## Objective

The aim of this project is to create a dataset by simulating a real-world phenomenon. The data will be simulated using the numpy.random module which is part of the NumPy Python library.

## Data

The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a monitoring programme whereby one third of our major rivers are surveyed and assessed each year by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Monitoring stations are placed at different XY spatial coordinates and samples are collected throughout the year to determine the quality of the water. A monitoring station at Knocknageragh Bridge, Templemore, Co. Tipperary was installed in February 2007 and to date 178 samples have been collected and analysed by the EPA laboratory in Kilkenny. The four variables that will be analysed from the samples collected will be level of ammonia, PH level, temperature and Total oxidised nitrogen.

- River Name - (categorical variable with one value Suir River)
- Station Name - (categorical variable with one value Knocknageragh Bridge)
- Sample Date - (date range)
- Ammonia - (non negative real numbers to two decimal places)
- PH - (non negative real numbers to two decimal places)
- Temperature - (non negative real numbers to two decimal places)
- Total Oxidised Nitrogen - (non negative real numbers to two decimal places)

## Repository

This repository contains a jupyter notebook called Simulation-Project-2018.ipynb. To run this notebook you must have [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. Jupyter comes pre-installed with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) python distribution package which I would advise you to install.
