# Simulation Project

## Objective

The aim of this project is to create a dataset by simulating a real-world phenomenon. The data will be simulated using the numpy.random module which is part of the NumPy Python library.

## Data

The dataset I will be simulating will include the following five variables:

- Sex - male or female (categorical variable with two values male or female)
- Smoker - yes or no (categorical variable with two values yes or no)
- Exercise - hours per week (integers)
- Resting heart beat - value between 40 and 120 (non zero positive integers)
- Age - value between 18 and 65 (non zero positive integers)

The above data will be collected (randomly generated) for 100 people at my place of work. I am interested to see if people's resting heart beat is lower if they exercise regularly and are a non-smoker. I believe a resting heart rate is not determined by your age but is dependent on your level of fitness and whether you smoke or not. I chose this project as I exercise in the gym 3 to 4 times a week, walk my dogs 7 days a week, I am a non-smoker and I have an average resting heart beat of 55 to 60 beats per minute. My investigation concluded that the more hours of exercise per week and not smoking resulted in a lower resting heart beat. 

## Repository

This repository contains a jupyter notebook called Simulation-Project-2018.ipynb. To run this notebook you must have [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. Jupyter comes pre-installed with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) python distribution package which I would advise you to install.
